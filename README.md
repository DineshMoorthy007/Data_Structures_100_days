# Daily Data Structures Code

Welcome to **Daily Data Structures Code** – a collection of practical, real-world examples demonstrating how data structure concepts are used in everyday programming tasks!

This repository showcases **common daily coding scenarios** solved using fundamental data structures, making abstract concepts concrete and immediately applicable.

---

## 🎯 **About This Repository**

Data structures aren't just theoretical concepts – they solve real problems every day! This repository contains:

- **Practical Python examples** showing data structures in action
- **Real-world use cases** like task management, data processing, and efficient algorithms
- **Clean, commented code** that's easy to understand and apply
- **Daily coding patterns** that developers encounter regularly

---

## 📂 **Code Examples**

### Queue Operations (Deque)
- **Breadth-First Task Management** - Managing tasks using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principles with `collections.deque`
- **Efficient Sliding Window Average** - Real-time data processing using fixed-size deque for moving averages

### List Operations
- **List Comprehensions with Conditional Logic** - Elegant data transformation and filtering

### Additional Resources
- **Basic Resources** - Curated learning materials from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks

---

## 🔧 **Core Data Structures Covered**

- **Arrays & Lists**: Dynamic arrays, list operations, and comprehensions
- **Queues & Deques**: FIFO operations, task scheduling, sliding windows
- **Strings**: Text manipulation and processing
- **Hash Tables**: Fast lookups and data organization
- **Trees & Graphs**: Hierarchical data and network traversal (coming soon)
- **Stacks**: LIFO operations for parsing and backtracking (coming soon)
